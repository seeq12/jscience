A stripped down fork of JScience's unit library (version 4.3.1) with various bug fixes.

* 4.3.2: Fixed an error with division order of operations.
* 4.3.3: Removed currency exchange support (all currencies on own dimension).
* 4.3.4: Added new dimensions to previously dimensionless concepts (radian, ppm, dB, and a few others).
